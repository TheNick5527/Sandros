	description = "The Homeworld of the Aviskree, and, due to their relatively short time in the stars, perhaps the only place in the Galaxy that is primarily Aviskree, \
	a rather small planet with a lower gravity, allowing the avian species to fly, the surface mostly covered in vast forests, though other biomes exist, including a large \
	ocean, dotted with islands.  Each major population center is centered around groves of a special tree, known as the Ranga, the fruit that spawned the bright coloration of the species. \
	The species is lead by a council of all 7 Aviskree Caste colorations."
